### Exam 1

**Rank: 4**

This paper was poorly organized and lacked clarity. With the entire paper consisting of two sections, the analysis and conclusion under the 'Data Preparation' section, and short text which doesn't explain what they did, it's not clear to me what analysis was performed. The claim that a better test score in high school is a "free ticket to any colleges" seems to come out of nowhere. If they were analyzing college acceptance rates this may have some grounding but they state they are analyzing high school test scores.

There are also a number of issues at a more detailed level. The variable names were all abbreviations that one would need a data dictionary to interpret. The tables were unformatted and look like code output. There were also too many digits in the tables to be readily interpretable. The plot is labeled "Avegrade" which is too brief, especially since they did a poor job explaining what 'Avegrade' is. At best, this paper feels like an outline/first draft that was thrown together in a few minutes.



### Exam 2

**Rank: **

The first word in paper is a grammatical error. The summary is good in that it provides background, methods, and results. However, they should have expanded a bit more. For example, they say teacher salary and enrollment influence drop-out rate but are these the only variables? Also, I'm not sure how controllable the covariates used are by a school/school board. The mean drop-out rate is 2. Apparently, this means 2%? They should have made this clear instead of leaving it up to the reader to infer.

In the first paragraph of the Statical Analysis section, I like how they justify their use of linear regression via its interpretability. The second paragraph provides an explanation of backwards elimination, which is good, however, I thought they went into too much detail. This paragraph is also a bit jumbled. It should be split into two paragraphs: one explaining the method, and another explaining the results. Actually, this first explanation of the model should be removed because this is not their final model. As readers, we don't really care about all their intermediate models. 



### Exam 5

**Rank: **

Right off the bat, the title contains a grammatical error which is not a good sign. I like how this paper has an executive summary to provide a short summary of the problem and results. However, they say they are predicting several different responses, but the paper doesn't explain these models beyond $R^2$. Also, it's not clear to me what the final model was. This is in part because they explain several models, one with a transformation, then state in the conclusion that a transformation was not used.

The title has a grammatical error; it should say "relate*d*" and not "relate". I like how this paper has an executive summary to provide a short summary of the problem and results. However, they say they are predicting several different responses, but the paper doesn't explain these models beyond $R^2$. Also, they use $R^2$ as a model selection criteria. In the introduction, I'm not sure what the difference between their usage of "multi-linear" vs. "multivariate". In the additional summary section, they say there are 20 variables, then say 11. They say variable selection was used but don't explain what method was used. Also, they list significant variables but list different variables after model selection. Which ones were used? Writing out the model as an 'equation' doesn't really add anything that the table doesn't provide. The go back and forth between the 'preliminary' model and the 'variable selection' model. Why so many tests for normality (Table 7)? The conclusion is about 1.5 pages while the text for the rest of the paper is about 2 pages. I still don't know what the model is. If they are trying to model a percent, why not use logistic regression?

The tables and figures need reformatting. There are too many digits in the tables, the figures are too small to really analyze, the variable names in the plots are abbreviations and have letters overlapping.


### Exam 11

**Rank: **

Summary: it seems like they're doing several analyses. Which one response are they using? Is this a prediction problem? First sentence of Introduction doesn't seem to imply this.

Intro: "if a difference .. did exist": well did it or did it not? Why did they use "proportional hypothesis testing" for one set of percentages and "hypothesis testing for equal means" for another set? Do we need a table explaining the type of each variable? The number of observations for each when it's stated that there are no missing values? Should be in Appendix if anything.

Statistical Analysis: Normality is not an assumption in a KS test. Did they test normality for **every** varible? Why? How can an average be 100 $\pm$ 20 units? "We have a problem modeling ...": this doesn't make sense. What is the meaning of $\ln (p/(1-p))$? What is $p$? How is logistic regression used if the response is $\in \mathbb{R}$?"This data point was altered ...": WHY!!!.  Don't use code abbreviations for variable names. Table a is code dump. Why $R^2$? Why are you presenting models that aren't your final model? Residual plots say "Log College". I don't remember them stating whether or not a log transform was applied.

What do you mean by "high" and "low"? Is the same method as before (regression) is used, why did you say hypothesis testing in the introduction?
